"WARNING!
Mysterious alien structures known as "Space Walls" are forming in your sector. Dont get trapped inside!
Fly carefully through the walls and escape to hyperspace!!!"

Space Walls was a nice weekend challenge in python and pygame. Its not perfect but i had a great time making it.The walls are randomly generated every time the game starts so no map is the same 

This is my first game and second program in python and the first game ive ever made in general. Im using Coded in Python 3.9 and pygame 2.1.3 , some ogg files containing the music i wrote for this and no images at all ,  the graphics are just geometrical shapes and colors.Every time the game starts it produces a random map of 1000 walls with a standard size of opening

in the include folder theres a json file called screen_settings where you can change the resolution of the game and if you want the game to start full screen or windowed. Also theres the score.txt where you can set the score to 0 if you like

The music and sound fx are inside the according sound folder and you can replace the music by replacing these files

in the zipped_exe folder you will find the game as a single .exe file plus the folders above
