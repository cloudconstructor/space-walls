"# space-walls" 

This is my first game in python and the first game ive ever made in general. Im using Coded in Python 3.9 and pygame 2.1.3 , some ogg files containing the music i wrote for this and no images at all.

All the graphigs are geometrical shapes and colors.

Its been super fun, there are surely more things to do on this but i only had the weekend to finish this and it was just a test. Probably in the future i will remake it using different methods and more optimized code.

The main issue ive noticed after converting the game to exe using pyinstaller is that the game runs slower and therefore is easier
